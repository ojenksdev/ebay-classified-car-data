Project Exploring the Data of eBay Car Classifieds In Germany. 

Using dataset provided by Dataquest, I was able to pull various insights from the data as I cleaned certain columns. Was able to practice aggregate looping over the dataframe to create dictionaries, and creating new dataframes by converting those dictionaries into series. All using Pandas. Pretty fun dataset to work with.
